            <p>The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh laptop computers by Apple Inc. that merged the PowerBook and iBook lines during the Mac transition to Intel processors.</p>
            <p>The MacBook family was initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody aluminum construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.</p>
            <li>The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air (2008–present) and the MacBook Pro (2006–present).</li>

            <header id="intro-header">Macbook 2008</header>
            <p>Introduced in February 2008, the MacBook (Early 2008) offered a modest speed bump over the MacBook (Late 2007 Discontinued). It was available in three configurations: 2.1 GHz/1 GB RAM/120 GB HD/ComboDrive/White/$1099, 2.4 GHz/2 GB RAM/160 GB HD/SuperDrive/White/$1299, and 2.4 GHz/2 GB RAM/250 GB HD/SuperDrive/Black/$1499</p>
            <p>In October 2008, the middle- and high-end models were replaced by the new Unibody models, while the low-end model was price-reduced to $999, and replaced in January 2009 by the MacBook (Early 2009).</p>
            <li>The MacBook's graphics chipset used a portion of main memory as VRAM. Though reported as a 144 MB graphics system, the chipset actually used up to 160 MB of RAM, resulting in a maximum of 864 MB of RAM available for system use in the base system.</li>

            <header id="intro-header">Macbook 2012</header>
            <p>Introduced in October 2012, the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012) brought the design and architectural improvements of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) to the 13-inch form factor. It included a Hi-DPI "Retina" display, solid-state storage, and the same processor and graphics chipset as its non-retina contemporary, the MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012), in a significantly thinner case.</p>
            <p>As with the 15-inch model, however, this required making compromises: the RAM was soldered to the motherboard and could not be upgraded, storage sizes were smaller, firewire and ethernet ports were replaced with optional thunderbolt adapters, there was no optical drive, and it was significantly more expensive than the non-retina models. The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012) shipped in two configurations, each with a 2.5 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 and 8 GB of RAM</p>
            <li>The MacBook Pro's graphics chipset used a portion of main memory as VRAM. Though reported as 768 MB, this was actually a minimum. Actual usage varied with graphics load, resulting in slightly less RAM available for system use.</li>

            <p>2016 marked the 25th aniversary for Apple’s line of portable computers. That year, Apple introduced its newest iteration of the Macbook at a special event in October. The refresh included a thinner, lighter chassis that rivaled the MacBook Air -- so much so that the Macbook Pro without the touchbar replaced it entirely (though Apple has strategically kept the Air available at an entry level price point of $999). </p>
            <p>Apple also unveiled with a new and revolutionary input device: the multitouch OLED Touch Bar, which replaced the row of traditional function keys and dynamically adapted for each active application. The Touch Bar models also included an integrated Touch ID sensor; Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports; a 50% larger trackpad; a second-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard; a brighter, wider gamut display in line with the iPhone 7 and iPad Pro; a significantly faster PCIe-based solid state drive; improved speakers with better dynamic range; and a new color previously only available in the 2015 MacBook -- space gray. Apple noted there were more online orders for the laptop than there has been for any previous Macbook Pro</p>
            <li>Bore a new generation of Macbooks that would define schematics for years to come.</li>

            <p>The MacBook "Core i7" 1.4 12-Inch (Mid-2017) features a 14-nm 1.4 GHz Intel "Core i7" Kaby Lake processor (I7-7Y75) with two independent processor "cores" on a single chip, a 4 MB level 3 cache, an "integrated" Intel HD Graphics 615 graphics processor that shares system memory, 8 GB of default onboard 1866 MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM (that could be upgraded to 16 GB at the time of purchase, but not afterwards), and either 256 GB or 512 GB of onboard flash storage (depending on whether the base configuration was the Core m3 or Core i5 model, respectively).</p>
            <p>This all is housed in a wafer thin (0.14-0.52 inch), 2.03 pound, aluminum case offered in Silver, a darker "Space Gray," Gold, and a pink-tinted "Rose Gold" color options (Gold option changed to a warmer shade and "Rose Gold" discontinued October 30, 2018). It has a low-resolution 480p FaceTime webcam, a backlit full-size keyboard with a thin "butterfly mechanism" keyboard design, a "Force Touch" trackpad, and a beautiful 12" TFT LED-backlit active-matrix "Retina" display (2304x1440 native resolution at 226 ppi). It delivers 10-12 hours of battery life depending on use.</p>
            <li>Compared to its predecessor, it is quite similar, but has a more advanced processor and graphics processor, faster storage, the option of twice as much RAM, reportedly better battery life, and a refined keyboard.</li>
