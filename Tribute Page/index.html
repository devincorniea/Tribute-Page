        <h2>Here is a brief timeline of Stephen's life.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Hawking was born on the 8th of January 1942 in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Hawking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17.</li>
        <br>
        <li>He obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.</li>
        <br>
        <li>By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole.</li>
        <br>
        <li>During his career, Hawking supervised 39 successful PhD students.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76. His family stated that he "died peacefully"</li>
